<summary><strong>Thrust Reverser Systems & Aviation Safety</strong></summary>

<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>

<p>Thrust reverser failures have caused fatal accidents:</p>

<p><strong>Lauda Air Flight 004 (1991):</strong> The left engine's thrust reverser deployed uncommanded during climb, causing an uncontrollable dive that killed 223 people. Investigators found 61 maintenance warnings in the month before, all inadequately addressed [1].</p>

<p><strong>TAM Airlines Flight 3054 (2007):</strong> Asymmetric thrust on landing (left engine in reverse, right engine at climb power) prevented spoilers and autobrakes from activating. The aircraft overran the runway, killing 199 people [2].</p>

<p>Both accidents share a common factor: asymmetric thrust reverser behaviour that existing monitoring systems failed to prevent.</p>

<h3>Relevance to This Project</h3>

<p>Current systems monitor each engine independently and alert pilots only after a fault occurs. This project introduces real-time synchronisation monitoring between both engines using AI, enabling detection of asymmetric deployment patterns before they become catastrophic.</p>
